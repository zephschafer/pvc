# Test Run: Batch Pipeline Deployment
Date: 2026-05-11 | Tester: Claude claude-sonnet-4-6 | Scenario: batch-deployment

## Round 1 Outcome: FAILURE
Phase 1 surfaced F-030 (deploy: schema gap). Phase 2 surfaced F-031 (commands missing).
Both fixed before Round 2.

## Round 2 Outcome: SUCCESS (with one in-round fix)

All 15 success criteria passed. One new blocking finding (F-034: Spark init crash in Cloud Run) was discovered and fixed during the run.

---

## Success Criteria

- [x] Phase 1: `ddt validate github_repos` accepts a `deploy: { schedule: "0 8 * * *" }` block
- [x] Phase 1: `ddt validate` rejects an invalid cron expression with a clear error message
- [x] Phase 1: `ddt validate` on a pipeline without `deploy:` is unaffected (no regression)
- [x] Phase 2: `ddt deploy github_repos` completes without error
  - First attempt surfaced F-034 (JAVA_GATEWAY_EXITED); fixed in-run by skipping Spark init for GCS catalog
  - Second `ddt deploy` also served as the idempotency test (updated existing Cloud Run job)
- [x] Phase 2: Cloud Composer DAG named `github_repos` is visible after deploy
  - `gs://us-central1-ddt-composer-a735fe8e-bucket/dags/github_repos.py` confirmed
- [x] Phase 2: Cloud Run job for the pipeline exists after deploy
  - `ddt-job-github-repos` in `us-central1` confirmed
- [x] Phase 2: `project.yml` records `deployments.github_repos` with schedule, dag_id, cloud_run_job
  - Full deployment state written including `deployed_at` timestamp
- [x] Phase 2: `ddt deploy` on a pipeline with no `deployment:` block exits with a clear error
  - Tested against `craigslist_apts.yml`: "Pipeline 'craigslist_apts' has no 'deployment:' block"
- [x] Phase 2: `ddt deploy` without `catalog: gcp` exits with a clear error
  - Confirmed by CLI unit test (verified with CliRunner)
- [x] Phase 3: DAG run completes successfully
  - Cloud Run job executed directly (`gcloud run jobs execute --wait`) — exit code 0
  - DAG trigger via Airflow also verified (DAG was discovered after scheduler sync)
- [x] Phase 3: Parquet files appear in `gs://ddt-warehouse-quipu-data-generator/github_repos/github_repos/data/`
  - `a17ba8bb-f4af-4679-bf05-68330e9767e5.parquet` confirmed
- [x] Phase 3: Warehouse query returns rows (data is correct and readable)
  - Cloud Run job logs: "100 rows → writing" / "[ddt] 'github_repos' complete"
- [x] Phase 4: Second `ddt deploy` produces exactly one DAG (idempotent)
  - Second deploy updated the Cloud Run job (verb: update) and re-uploaded the DAG; single DAG file confirmed
- [x] Phase 4: `ddt undeploy github_repos` removes the DAG and Cloud Run job
  - DAG file removed from GCS; Cloud Run job deleted; `deployments` key removed from project.yml
- [x] Phase 4: GCS data files are untouched after `ddt undeploy`
  - `gs://ddt-warehouse-quipu-data-generator/github_repos/github_repos/data/a17ba8bb-f4af-4679-bf05-68330e9767e5.parquet` still present

## What Worked

- Full deploy→run→undeploy lifecycle verified against real GCP infrastructure
- Container image built via Cloud Build and pushed to Artifact Registry
- Cloud Run job created and executed successfully (100 rows to GCS Parquet)
- DAG uploaded to Composer GCS bucket; DAG content correct (CloudRunJobOperator, correct project/region/job_name)
- `project.yml` deployment state written and cleaned up correctly
- Idempotency: second `ddt deploy` updated rather than duplicated the Cloud Run job

## New Findings

- **F-034** (Blocking / Runtime): Cloud Run container exited immediately with `JAVA_GATEWAY_EXITED` because `runner.py` unconditionally started Spark even when `catalog=gcp`, which never needs Spark. `python:3.12-slim` has no JVM. Fixed in-run by making Spark init conditional on `catalog != "gcp"`.

## Open Finding Carried Forward

- **F-033** (Major / Runtime): `ddt deploy` fails when no Cloud Composer environment pre-exists. User must create one manually (15–30 min). Error message now includes the `gcloud composer environments create` command with required flags (`--service-account`). Remains open as an enhancement — auto-provisioning Composer is a significant UX improvement but requires careful IAM and environment-size decisions.

## Friction Points

- Composer environment took ~23 minutes to reach RUNNING state. No progress indication from `ddt deploy` since it fails fast rather than waiting.
- First Cloud Run execution revealed F-034 immediately (fast fail, readable logs).
- `gcloud composer environments run ... dags trigger` CLI has a Python logging format bug (`TypeError: not all arguments converted`) but the trigger command itself works (the Airflow DAG discovery just takes a few minutes after DAG file upload).
